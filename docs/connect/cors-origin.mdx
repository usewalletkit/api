You must configure a list of allowed origins in the WalletKit dashboard for CORS to work. This is a security measure to prevent malicious websites from using your Project ID.

Head over to the [Settings page](https://app.usewalletkit.com/settings) in the
WalletKit dashboard.

Under the **Allowed Origin** section, add a list of comma separated origins that
you want to allow. For example, if you want to allow `https://example.com` and
`https://example.org`, you would enter:

```
https://example.com, https://example.org
```
