### Welcome!

WalletKit provides SDKs and APIs to build mobile-first web3 apps. At its core, WalletKit provides APIs to create 
and manage embedded, gasless, and recoverable wallets. These APIs are augmented with no-code tools and APIs to 
build with tokens and NFTs. Together, WalletKit can be used to build full-fledged web3 apps. Everything has been 
designed to get you up and running quickly. If you are new to blockchain, you don't have to learn any complex concepts. 
If you are a seasoned developer, you can focus on your product and ship faster.

At a high-level, we provide APIs and tools to build with wallets, tokens, and NFTs:
