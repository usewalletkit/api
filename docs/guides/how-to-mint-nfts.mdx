Creating and distributing NFTs can be complicated and time-consuming, as it involves dealing with smart contracts, private key signing, paying for gas, and managing blockchain operations. With WalletKit, it will be a few simple HTTP API calls.

### Use Cases

Here are some ideas for NFT use cases:

1. Rewards and loyalty: NFT is minted to user as a proof of status, e.g. Gold status for travelers flying 50K miles in a year.
2. Branding and Marketing Campaigns: Nike's NFT sneaker project bringing the sneaker product line brand to a new level with NFT Airdrops and sales.
3. Membership: NFT function as membership card to token-gated communities.

### Goal

This guide will show you how to use WalletKit to create Gold status NFT for the [ Airline Rewards & Loyalty Program](/reference/rewards-loyalty-program) mentioned in earlier guide.

### Setup

Make sure you do the following first:

1. Setup your WalletKit account
2. Obtain your Project ID and API Secret from the API Keys page.
3. Buy some gas. You can do this from the dashboard. Have 0.01 MATIC available, although we'll use a lot less.

### Create GOLD NFT Collection

Use the [Create NFT Collection API](/api-reference/nfts/create-nft-collection) to create NFT collection.

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/nfts/collections' \
     --user <project id>:<api secret> \
     --data '
{
   "network": "Polygon",
   "name": "Sky Airline Gold Member",
   "symbol": "SAGM",
   "secret": "testnet-secret"
}
'
```

Response will contain the created NFT collection `contract_address`, which is needed in mint API call

```json JSON
{
  "contract_address": "0x2b0bbdfef86b1979f931317252fd4d73e506c1b1",
  "network": "Polygon",
  "status": "pending",
  "transaction_hash": "0x07c782dcba4cc90d22047f93dbe5f6ccdf66ab6628dae2eeb528114baa9d1399"
}
```

### Upload NFT Image (Optional)

This step is optional if you already have the image hosted some where, and have the image uri ready to be used.

In the case where you would like to upload the image of NFT to be hosted on IPFS, use the [Upload NFT image API](/api-reference/nfts/upload-nft-image).

```bash cURL
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/nfts/upload' \
  --user <project id>:<api secret> \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F file=@path/to/gold_membership.jpeg
```

An IPFS url will be returned by the API.

```json JSON
{"ipfs_url":"ipfs://bafybeies72zw3kxh3dmgsmwyh5th7wk4kovnodhahn32s3oruorihs7qua/gold_membership.jpeg"}
```

### Mint NFTs

Let's say the wallet of the first traveler `Alice` who achieve Gold status is `0x976Cf57B7EE1D84E73BE9115457889d49a8A1335`, call [Mint NFT API](/api-reference/nfts/mint-nft) with the traveler's wallet as the `recipient`, and the NFT collection created in previous step as `contract_address`. Put the image url in the`metadata.image` field.

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/nfts/mint' \
     --user <project id>:<api secret> \
     --data '
{
   "contract_address": "0x2b0bbdfef86b1979f931317252fd4d73e506c1b1",
   "network": "Polygon",
   "recipient": "0x976Cf57B7EE1D84E73BE9115457889d49a8A1335",
   "metadata": {
     "name": "Gold member #1",
     "description": "Skyline Airline Gold Member enjoys unlimited seat upgrades, 40% more awarded miles ...",
     "image": "ipfs://bafybeies72zw3kxh3dmgsmwyh5th7wk4kovnodhahn32s3oruorihs7qua/gold_membership.jpeg"
   },
   "secret": "testnet-secret"
}
'
```

The above call mint an NFT out of the `Sky Airline Gold Member` NFT Collection to the Alice's wallet, now her status becomes GOLD!
